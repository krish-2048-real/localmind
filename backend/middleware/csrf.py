"""
CSRF Protection Middleware — Origin / Referer Validation

Strategy: Verifying Origin with Standard Headers (OWASP recommended).

For every state-changing request (POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE) the middleware
checks the `Origin` header sent by the browser.  If the header is present
and its value is NOT in the configured allow-list, the request is rejected
with HTTP 403 before it reaches any route handler.

Why missing Origin is allowed:
    - Same-origin browser requests (frontend served by the same FastAPI
      process in production) may omit the Origin header per the Fetch spec.
    - Direct API calls (curl, pytest TestClient) also omit it.
    - Neither of those is a CSRF vector — CSRF requires a *different-origin*
      page to silently trigger the request on behalf of the victim.

Why this is sufficient without cookies / tokens:
    - LocalMind has no cookies and no browser-managed credentials.
    - Browsers MUST include Origin on cross-origin fetch() mutations
      (Fetch spec §3.1).  An attacker page will always reveal itself via a
      non-allowlisted Origin value.

    Combines Origin/Referer CSRF validation and SQLite-backed Request
    Deduplication.

    Rejects state-changing requests whose Origin header is present but not in
    the configured allowlist.  Also persists in-flight and completed request
    signatures to ``dedupe_cache`` (SQLite) so that duplicate submissions
    within ``_DEDUPE_WINDOW_SECONDS`` are served from cache rather than
    re-executing the handler.

    **Known Limitations:**
    - Error responses (4xx/5xx) are NOT cached. This ensures clients can retry
      immediately without receiving a replayed failure.
    - Multi-worker deployments (e.g. Gunicorn with multiple workers) are not fully
      supported by the deduplication logic. SQLite WAL is shared, but concurrent
      writes use last-write-wins. This is acceptable for LocalMind's single-user,
      single-worker architecture.
