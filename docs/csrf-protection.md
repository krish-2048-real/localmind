# Security Middleware — CSRF & Deduplication

## Overview

LocalMind's `SecurityMiddleware` protects state-changing API endpoints through two distinct mechanisms:
1. **CSRF Protection**: Validates Origin / Referer headers (an OWASP recommended defence).
2. **Request Deduplication**: Uses a short-lived SQLite cache to idempotently handle duplicate requests (e.g. from UI double-clicks).

## Threat Model

CSRF attacks require an attacker's page to silently trigger a state-changing
request on behalf of a victim who is simultaneously logged in to the target
service.

LocalMind is an **offline, single-user tool with no authentication or cookies**.
This significantly reduces the CSRF surface, but a residual risk exists:

| Attack vector | Protected? |
|---|---|
| Malicious internet page → `http://localhost:8000` | ✅ Yes — browser sends `Origin: https://evil.com`; rejected |
| DNS-rebinding (attacker domain → 127.0.0.1) | ✅ Yes — `Origin` still carries the attacker's domain |
| Same-LAN attacker directly calling the API | ⚠️ Out of scope — direct network access, not CSRF |

## Implementation

### Middleware: `backend/middleware/csrf.py`

`SecurityMiddleware` wraps every request, executing the following phases:

#### Phase 1: CSRF Validation
1. **Safe methods** (`GET`, `HEAD`, `OPTIONS`) — always passed through.
2. **Mutating methods** (`POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`):
   - If **no `Origin` header** is present → request is allowed.
     *(Same-origin browser requests and direct API clients omit the header
     — neither is a CSRF vector.)*
   - If `Origin` is present and **matches** an entry in `CORS_ORIGINS` → allowed.
   - If `Origin` is present and **does not match** → `HTTP 403` is returned
     before the request reaches any route handler.
3. **`Referer` fallback** — when `Origin` is absent but `Referer` is present,
   the header is normalised to `scheme://host` and checked against the same
   list.
4. **Failure recovery** — if an unexpected exception occurs during origin parsing
   or validation, the middleware catches the exception, logs an error traceback,
   and returns `HTTP 500` (`Security verification error: middleware failure recovery triggered`)
   to guarantee a fail-closed security posture.


#### Phase 2: Request Deduplication
For allowed mutating requests, the middleware hashes the request (IP, method, path, and body) to prevent duplicate executions:
- **First Request**: Stores a `'processing'` sentinel in `dedupe_cache` (SQLite) and forwards the request.
- **Concurrent Duplicate**: If a matching request arrives while the first is still processing, it immediately receives `HTTP 409 Conflict`.
- **Completed Request**: The response body and headers are persisted to the database. Identical requests arriving within the next 5 seconds are served directly from this cache.
- **Error Responses (4xx/5xx)**: If the backend returns an error, the `'processing'` sentinel is immediately deleted. Errors are NOT cached, ensuring the client can retry and succeed immediately when the transient condition clears.

### Integration: `backend/app.py`

```python
app.add_middleware(GZipMiddleware, minimum_size=1000)
app.add_middleware(SecurityMiddleware, allowed_origins=cors_origins)
app.add_middleware(CORSMiddleware, ...)
```

The middleware is registered **between** GZip and CORS so that rejected
requests never receive `Access-Control-Allow-*` headers.

## Configuration

The allowed-origins list is read from the `CORS_ORIGINS` environment variable
(already required for CORS). No additional configuration is needed.

```dotenv
# .env
CORS_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000,http://127.0.0.1:3000,http://localhost:5173
```

To add a new allowed origin (e.g. a staging URL), append it to `CORS_ORIGINS`.
The CSRF check will automatically pick it up.

## Testing

```bash
# Run all tests including the CSRF suite
pytest backend/tests/ -v

# Run only CSRF tests
pytest backend/tests/test_csrf.py -v
```

### Manual verification

```bash
# Should return 403
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" \
  -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/sessions/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Origin: https://evil.com" \
  -d '{"title":"attack"}'

# Should return 200 (no Origin = direct/same-origin access)
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" \
  -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/sessions/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"title":"ok"}'
```

## Design Decisions

### Why Origin Validation instead of Double-Submit Cookie?

| | Origin Validation | Double-Submit Cookie |
|---|---|---|
| Lines of code | ~110 | ~210 |
| Frontend changes | None | Yes (3 places) |
| New cookies | None | Yes |
| New dependencies | None | None |
| OWASP listed defence | ✅ | ✅ |

For an application with no cookies and no browser-managed credentials, the
Double-Submit Cookie pattern would introduce a cookie into an architecture
that deliberately has none. Origin validation provides equivalent protection
with half the code and zero frontend impact.

### Why is missing Origin allowed?

Per the [Fetch specification §3.1](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/), browsers
omit the `Origin` header on same-origin requests. Blocking missing-Origin
requests would break the application when the frontend is served by the same
FastAPI process (production mode). It would also break direct API access from
`curl` and the `pytest` test client — neither of which is a CSRF attack.

### Single-Worker Deduplication Design

The Request Deduplication logic uses a SQLite WAL-mode database to store cached responses. While SQLite handles concurrency well, the middleware design assumes a single-worker architecture (default for LocalMind):

- **Concurrency Strategy**: We use `INSERT OR REPLACE` for the `'processing'` and `'done'` states. 

- **Multi-Worker Limit**: If deployed with multiple Uvicorn/Gunicorn workers, two workers processing the same request in parallel might overwrite each other's cached responses (last-write-wins). This is perfectly acceptable for a local, single-user tool but is documented here for future maintainers exploring scaling out.
### Why Fail-Closed Failure Recovery?

If header processing or origin validation fails unexpectedly (e.g. malformed headers or runtime errors during header inspection), allowing the request to proceed without validation could bypass security checks. Failing closed with an HTTP 500 error response and logging the traceback guarantees that security checks are strictly enforced.
